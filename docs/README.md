# Project Frigo

The goal of this project is to create an intelligent fridge using Java, an Arduino, and a Thermoelectric plate.


### Building

To build this project, you need:
* a JDK, a JRE
* Eclipse
* Arduino IDE


### Deployement

You need the following:
* an Arduino
* a Thermoelectric Plate
* a DHT-11 or DHT-22  humidity + temperature  sensor

You can then follow the following schematic:
